The Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity Model for Variance (ARCH):

Implemented and analyzed ARCH and GARCH models on stock return data to forecast volatility and assess model fit using AIC/BIC criteria and autocorrelation diagnostics.

ARCH provides a way to model volatility in a dynamic market where volatility shocks are typically followed by prolonged, high volitility. Heteroskedasticity refers to the fact that current market volatility is highly dependent on previous market volatility. ARCH is a parametric, iterative, recursive model that uses Gaussian Likelihood Minimization to solve for weight parameters that model volatility.
